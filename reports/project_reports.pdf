1. Executive Summary & Problem FramingThe Business Problem: The telecom company faces a 26.5% churn rate. The goal is to identify who is leaving and why, to prioritize retention efforts.The Metric that Matters: We prioritized Recall (catching as many churners as possible) and AUC-ROC (probability ranking accuracy). Missing a churner (False Negative) is costlier than annoying a loyal customer with a retention offer (False Positive).2. Data Preparation & Advanced Feature EngineeringWe didn't just use raw columns; we created "Behavioral Features" to capture the human element behind the data.TotalServices: Count of add-ons (Security, Backup, etc.). Hypothesis: More services = Higher switching costs.AvgCostPerService: Monthly Charges / Total Services. Hypothesis: Customers paying high fees for few services feel "ripped off."Risk_FiberM2M: A specific flag for "Fiber Optic" users on "Month-to-Month" contracts. This group is notoriously volatile.3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)The "Stickiness" Insight: As shown in the "Probability of Churn by Number of Services" plot, churn drops dramatically as customers add more services. A customer with 0-1 services has a >40% chance of leaving. A customer with 4+ services has <10% chance.Contract Risk: Month-to-month contracts are the single biggest predictor of churn.Tenure Cliff: The "Tenure Density" plot reveals a massive spike in churn during months 0–12. If a customer survives the first year, they are likely to stay for 4+ years.4. Model PerformanceWe trained two models. Logistic Regression slightly outperformed Random Forest in this specific case, likely because the relationships are linear (e.g., lower tenure = higher churn).MetricLogistic RegressionRandom ForestAccuracy81%80%ROC-AUC0.840.84Recall (Churners)56%52%Top Predictors (Feature Importance):Contract (Month-to-Month): The #1 risk factor.Tenure: New customers are the most vulnerable.TotalCharges: High lifetime value correlates with retention.InternetService (Fiber Optic): Surprisingly high churn, indicating potential dissatisfaction with price or reliability.5. Postdictive Analysis (The "Why")The final_churn_prediction_analysis.csv file compares our predictions against reality.Where we won: The model perfectly flags "Price Sensitive Hoppers"—customers with high monthly bills, month-to-month contracts, and low tenure.Where we lost: The model missed "Long-Term Sleepers"—loyal customers of 5+ years who suddenly left. This suggests we need "Event Data" (e.g., a recent service outage) to catch them.6. Business RecommendationsThe "Bundle & Save" Strategy: Since churn drops with TotalServices, aggressive upsell campaigns should target 0-1 service customers. "Get Online Backup for $1" is a retention play, not just revenue.The "Year-One" Bridge: Implement a "3-Month Check-in" for new customers. Churn is highest in year 1; surviving this period creates long-term value.Fiber Optic Audit: Fiber users churn more than DSL users despite faster speeds. Investigate if this is due to technical outages or aggressive competitor pricing in fiber zones.7. DeliverablesBelow is the complete, clean code block for your Jupyter Notebook.
